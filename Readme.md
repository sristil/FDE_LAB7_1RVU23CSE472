# **Graph Database Modeling and Querying (Neo4j)**  

## üß† **Summary**
This project focuses on building a **Graph Database Model** using **Neo4j** for an e-commerce platform called **ShopSmart**. It demonstrates how entities like **Users**, **Products**, **Brands**, **Categories**, and **Reviews** can be represented as interconnected nodes with relationships such as **BOUGHT**, **VIEWED**, **RATED**, and **BELONGS_TO**.

CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and analytical queries are performed using **Cypher Query Language** to analyze product performance, user behavior, and recommendation patterns. The project highlights how graph databases efficiently represent **complex, highly connected data**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Tools Used**
- Neo4j Desktop  
- Neo4j Browser  
- Cypher Query Language

## üß© **Lab Stages**

### ‚úÖ Stage 1: Installation & Setup
- Install Neo4j Desktop  
- Create and start the **ShopSmart** database  
- Access it using Neo4j Browser  

### ‚úÖ Stage 2: Graph Creation (Data Modeling)
- Create nodes: **User**, **Product**, **Category**, **Brand**, **Review**  
- Create relationships like `:BOUGHT`, `:VIEWED`, `:RATED`, `:BELONGS_TO`  
- Validate graph visualization  

### ‚úÖ Stage 3: Basic Data Retrieval
- Execute read queries using `MATCH`, `WHERE`, `RETURN`, `WITH`  

### ‚úÖ Stage 4: Data Modification
- Update nodes/relationships using `SET`, `MERGE`, `REMOVE`  

### ‚úÖ Stage 5: Data Deletion
- Remove data using `DELETE` and `DETACH DELETE` safely  

### ‚úÖ Stage 6: Advanced Analytical Queries
- Perform aggregations and pattern analysis using functions like `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`

## üìä **Expected Output**
- Fully functional **ShopSmart graph model**  
- Successful CRUD and analytical query execution  
- Relationship visualizations in Neo4j Browser
